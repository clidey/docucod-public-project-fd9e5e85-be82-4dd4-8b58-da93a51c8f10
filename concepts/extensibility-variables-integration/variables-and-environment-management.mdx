## Understanding Variables and Environment Management in Task

Effective automation requires flexible, context-aware variable handling to customize task workflows dynamically. In Task, variables and environment variables work in concert to provide layered configuration scopes. This page unveils the design and behavior of Task’s variable system, guiding you through how variables are scoped, inherited, and resolved alongside environment variables to produce seamless, adaptable automation.

### The Core Idea: Layered Variable Scopes and Environment Resolution

At the heart of Task’s configuration lies a layered model blending environment variables, Taskfile-defined variables, and task-specific variables. Environment variables provide a foundational context exposing your shell or system configuration, while Taskfiles introduce structured variable definitions scoped globally or at task granularity. Variables can be static, dynamically generated by shell commands, or inherited from included Taskfiles and dotenv files. The result is a hierarchical, flexible variable system where inner scopes override outer scopes and dynamic resolution allows embedding command outputs right into variable values.

This layered approach empowers users to build complex, modular Taskfiles that remain both readable and maintainable, while letting tasks adapt their behavior based on environment, invocation parameters, or external command outputs.

### How Variables and Environment Fit Together

Variables in Task are represented internally as key-value pairs with additional metadata to support dynamic content. These variables come from multiple sources: the operating system environment, Taskfile `vars`, environment mappings, dotenv files, task-level overrides, and variables passed during task calls. When Task prepares to execute a task, it resolves all these layers into an environment that the task’s commands run within.

The resolution starts by importing OS environment variables exactly as they exist, building an initial map. Then, Task overlays variables declared globally in the Taskfile followed by higher precedence scopes such as task-level `vars` and explicit environment variables (`env`) defined in tasks. Variables passed inline during task calls further take precedence. This cascade respects scoping rules while preserving environment integrity.

Dynamic variables declared with shell commands execute once per invocation and cache their results to avoid repeated calls, seamlessly injecting computed values into the variable map. Notably, environment variables with the `TASK_` prefix are accessible in commands and variable expansions, enabling intricate interactions between environment and Taskfile variables.

### Practical Variable Inheritance and Overriding in Workflows

Consider a typical scenario where your root Taskfile declares a global variable and environment variable. An included Taskfile or a called sub-task can override these variables locally, yet still inherit values from the root scope unless explicitly replaced. Dotenv files augment the environment by injecting values from `.env` files referenced at various levels, allowing external configuration without modifying YAML files directly.

For example, a root Taskfile might load a `global.env` file with environment variables and define `VAR` in global `vars`. The default task could load additional dotenv files and override `VAR` when calling a sub-task, which itself defines `VAR` and environment variables within its scope. This setup ensures that commands within each task see the correct variable values matching their intended scope, with dynamic resolution if shell commands are used in variable definitions.

This model allows modular Taskfiles with clear boundaries and predictable behavior, ideal for complex builds or deployment pipelines requiring environment-specific tweaks.

<Tip>
Use dotenv files at the Taskfile or task level to inject environment variables flexibly. Variables from `.env` files are loaded only if the files exist, avoiding errors for missing files.
</Tip>

### Variable Life Cycle and Resolution Flow

When executing a task, Task follows a clear process to resolve variables:

- **Capture OS Environment**: Reads all environment variables defined in the user's shell or system.
- **Overlay Global Taskfile Variables**: Applies variables defined under `vars` and `env` at the root Taskfile level.
- **Apply Included Taskfile Variables**: If the task includes other Taskfiles, their variables merge in with appropriate scoping.
- **Incorporate Task-Level Variables**: Applies the task’s own `vars` and `env` mappings.
- **Process Variables from Task Calls**: Adds or overrides variables passed during dependent task invocations.
- **Evaluate Dynamic Variables**: Runs shell commands specified in variable definitions to produce values, caching the results to optimize repeated accesses.

The fully composed variable set is then translated into environment variables for the underlying shell commands, respecting data types that can be converted to strings, skips unsupported types, and avoids overwriting existing environment variables unless the experimental precedence is enabled.

This flow ensures that each command executes with the combined, contextually appropriate environment, enabling fine-grained customization and dynamic configurations.

<Note>
Variable evaluation supports dynamic shell commands (`sh` key in var definitions). Such variables execute only once per variable cache lifecycle to improve performance. Running `task.~compiler.ResetCache()` clears cached values if dynamic recomputation is needed.
</Note>

### Best Practices for Variable and Environment Management

Balancing flexibility and clarity in variable usage helps prevent common pitfalls:

- Prefer defining global variables and environment variables at the Taskfile root for shared settings.
- Use task-level variables and environment mappings to override or specialize behavior locally.
- Leverage dotenv files to separate secret or environment-specific config from Taskfiles.
- Avoid naming conflicts by understanding that `env` keys map directly to environment variables seen by tasks.
- Use dynamic shell command variables judiciously, as they may introduce execution overhead.
- Use the `TASK_` prefix for environment variables intended for Task’s internal use or to avoid collision.

These recommendations lead to clearer, more maintainable Taskfiles with predictable behavior across environments.
