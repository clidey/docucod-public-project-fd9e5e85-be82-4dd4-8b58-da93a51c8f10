# Getting Help and Participating in the Task Community

When using Task to automate your workflows, having access to reliable support channels and engaging with the broader community can dramatically improve your experience. This page connects you to places where you can get real-time help, report issues, and contribute your expertise to shape the future of Task.

## Finding Real-Time Assistance and Community Support

If you run into challenges or need quick answers while using Task, connecting with the community or maintainers is invaluable. The **Discord server** provides an interactive space with dedicated channels where you can ask questions, share tips, or discuss ideas with both users and the core developers. It’s a friendly environment to gain insights or resolve blockers as you work on your automation tasks.

Additionally, the GitHub **Discussions** and **Issue Tracker** allow you to seek help asynchronously. Use Discussions for broader topics, feature requests, and user-to-user support, whereas the Issue Tracker is primarily for reporting bugs or requesting improvements. Both are actively monitored by maintainers, ensuring your feedback and questions get proper attention.

## Reporting Issues to Improve Task

When you encounter unexpected behavior, errors, or want to suggest improvements, the best way is to submit detailed reports via the GitHub **Issue Tracker**. Providing clear reproductions of problems, including Taskfile snippets and command outputs, helps maintainers diagnose and fix issues efficiently. Before opening a new issue, checking existing issues can save time and avoid duplicates.

If you are uncertain whether a problem is a bug or a configuration mistake, the community channels are a great place to validate your concerns.

## Contributing Your Expertise

Task thrives because of its vibrant open-source community. Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation, your contributions make a difference. The [**Contributing Guide**](./contributing.md) lays out all the necessary steps, from setting up your development environment to submitting pull requests.

You can also help by maintaining integrations or packaging for your preferred platforms, as many installation methods are community-maintained. Sharing your enhancements through pull requests or suggesting new community integrations helps everyone benefit.

Many people contribute by **reporting bugs**, **answering questions**, and **reviewing pull requests**, which is equally valued.

## Additional Community Resources

There is a wealth of community involvement beyond direct contributions to the core project. For example, the list of [community-maintained integrations](./integrations.md#community-integrations) showcases tools and extensions built around Task.

Open collective pages, contributor graphs, and discussion forums serve as social hubs where you can track project health and meet fellow users.


<Tip>
Engage regularly on Discord and GitHub Discussions for the latest announcements and support. This helps you stay up to date and avoid duplicated efforts.

## Summary

Connecting with the Task community is essential for maximizing your productivity and confidence in automation.

Contributions are warmly welcomed in code, documentation, packaging, and support. Your involvement powers the continuous improvement and wider adoption of Task.
